Usage
This a restaurant reservation application created with the intent to keep user-friendly, organized reservations and table assignments. This was designed with a business perspective in mind, with the ability to create, edit, and cancel reservations, as well as the ability to create and removing tables.

Reservations can be assigned to specific tables. Reservations are listed by specified date, defaulting to the current date on the dashboard. There are buttons to toggle the date to view reservations past, present, and future. Reservations can be searched by phone number, previous, current, and future.

Build Notes
This is a full-stack application built using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CSS Bootstrap, Express, Node, Knex, and PostgreSQL. The API was built following RESTful API principles.

This application was deployed as a monorepo using Heroku CLI.
